Today's Topic: Time with Friends
Discussion Questions:
1. How often do you meet your friends?
2. What do you do with your friends?
3. Do you feel like your relationship with you friends changes as you go through different phases in life?

my opinions

1. If I were to meet friends, it would be about once a week or once every two weeks.
2. When meeting friends, I usually chat over coffee at a café or have a drink and a talk in the evening.
3. My approach to socialising with friends may have changed since the old days. Back then, we'd drink until the last train departed, meet up on the spur of the moment, or have lengthy phone conversations.
Nowadays, I confirm the date in advance, carefully consider the venue and topics of conversation, and bring a small gift to show consideration for the family of whoever has made time for me.
It's perhaps become what you might call a more mature way of socialising.

- they attack for sucking human blood
- they have fangs, they never die
- they are active at night and appearing suddenly.

Topic: Smartwatches
Discussion Questions:

my opinions

1. I've been using smartwatch, Apple Watch 6th, for about 5 years.
I purchased it because I wanted to measure heart rate and sleep logs.
2. This is specific to the Apple Watch, but I think it's good.
For iPhone users, it offers many conveniences and integrates with smart home systems.
For tech-savvy individuals, it serves as a remote control, provides instant access to timers,
and allows quick awareness of notifications and calls - all of which are very useful.
3. As for other smart devices, I've installed something called “Switch Bot” to manage my air conditioner and lighting remotes from my phone.
This lets me centrally control appliances that use infrared signals, making it convenient to operate them remotely from my phone or set schedules.
It also syncs with a thermometer, so it can automatically adjust the remote's temperature settings and turn appliances on/off based on rising or falling indoor/outdoor temperatures.
Additionally, I've attached a gadget to my house key, so it's now an auto-lock that opens with my smartphone.

Discussion Questions:
1. Do you enjoy doing housework? Why or why not?
2. What is your least favorite chore?  Why?

my opinions

1. I do some houseworks, washing (to use washing machine), drying outside, fold dried closes.
And do cooking sometimes.
Drying clothes outside depends on the weather, and if it rains, it's the worst—just means washing them again. folding closes is very annoying.
Cooking is something we have to do, but I do it without much emotion. As long as it's nutritionally balanced, fills me up, and tastes good, I basically think anything will do.
I like things that are easy.
2. I don't like cleaning. That's why I let my cleaning robot do the cleaning.
For me, cleaning means occasionally cleaning the robot itself and cleaning the corners it missed.

2. What scares me are people I can't trust, people who lie naturally,
and people whose thoughts I can't fathom.
I don't find invisible things particularly frightening because I can ignore them,
but I find things that are visible yet incomprehensible to be scary.
3. When I was sitting on the sofa and thought I'd stepped on something,
only to find it was a caterpillar. I let out a weird sound.
4. I think about what I can do.
For example, if I find an insect, I consider whether to confront it,
throw it outside, or find some kind of weapon.

I think about escape routes while telling myself this won't last long, and I endure it.

2. If you had a soundtrack for your life, what would it be? What kind of music? What songs? Why?
3. Has your taste in music changed during your life? How did it change?

my opinions

1. "Rocket Dive" by hide with SpreadBeaver. It's rock music of Japanese Rock band.
When I listen to this song, I receive a very positive message.
When this song was written, the person who wrote the song, hide, was probably feeling down himself because the band was about to break up.
However, he thought about his fans and immediately delivered this song to them with the message of venturing out into a new world.
I think about that every time I listen to the song and feel positive about it.
2. If there is a soundtrack to my life, I want it to be light, sometimes exciting, fast, and excitingly uplifting, but with a peaceful message.
It can be instrumental, and if it is a vocal song with lyrics, I feel that a singer's voice should be high pitched and pleasing to the ear.
3. I still love the songs I used to listen to in my late teens. I don't think my tastes have changed much since then.
Recently I often see playlists of songs from that time on apple music and other sites, and they catch my eye. When I listen to them, I feel very nostalgic and new.
